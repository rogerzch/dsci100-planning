I will construct this using the `sessions.csv` data by converting the session start and end times into date–time objects and aggregating all sessions that overlap each hour into hourly counts of unique `hashedEmail` values. The main explanatory variables will be the hour of day (0–23) and an indicator for weekday versus weekend; I may also explore additional calendar features such as the month or whether the day falls during school holidays.\n",

This hourly dataset can later be used to fit a regression model that predicts expected hourly demand and to identify which time periods have the highest usage.\n"
