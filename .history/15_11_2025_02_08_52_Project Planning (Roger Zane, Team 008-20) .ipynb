    "My specific question is: Can time-of-day information, such as the hour of day and whether the time falls on a weekday or a weekend, be used to predict the average number of concurrent players on the server in a given one-hour window?\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this question, I will use the `sessions.csv` data. First, I will convert the `start_time` variable to a date-time object and use `mutate` to extract the calendar date and the hour of day (0–23) for each session. Then, following the group-by and summarize patterns we used in class, I will `group_by` date and hour and `summarize` the number of unique `hashedEmail` values to obtain the number of players online in each hour. This will give an hourly-level dataset with one row per hour and a numerical response variable equal to the (average) number of concurrent players. In later stages of the project, this hourly-level dataset can be used to fit a predictive model, such as a k-nearest neighbours regression, with the time-of-day variables as explanatory predictors.\n",
